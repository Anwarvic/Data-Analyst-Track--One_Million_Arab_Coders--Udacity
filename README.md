# Data Analyst Track (One Million Arab Coders--Udacity)

This repo contains my solution to the Data Analyst Track for the One Million Arab Coders program by Udacity 2018. For more information, this is the [official website](http://www.arabcoders.ae/en/) for the mentioned program. And this is the [program page](https://ae.udacity.com/one-million-arab-coders/en) over Udacity.

The One Million Arab Coders program is part of the Mohammed bin Rashid Global Initiatives (MBRGI), the charitable foundation dedicated to spreading education and knowledge across the Arab world.

The program aims to empower one million Arabs with essential skills required for employment in the future – Coding -- through a series of online courses and certifications. The program will offer an opportunity for students and tutors to be involved in one of the four different developer tracks that are in high demand: Front End Web Development, Back End Web Development, Data Analysis and Android Development.





# Available Tracks

### 1. Full-stack Web Developer

Want to think and problem-solve like a programmer? This program will help familiarize you with some of the most essential skills that full-stack developers use on a regular basis. You will have a chance to explore fundamental programming concepts in Python like logic checks, data structures, and functions through interactive quizzes - and you will get to practice on your own computer. You will also learn syntax, debugging techniques and basic problem-solving concepts. Finally, you will learn object-oriented programming through a series of mini-projects and exercises using a variety of Python libraries. By the end of the program, you will be programmatically sending text messages, decoding secret messages, and drawing images with Python. Finally, you will also receive in-depth instruction on one of the most powerful tools available to programmers, Github, and how you can use Github to create code repos, commit changes to code, and review commits to existing code repos.



### 2. Android Developer

This program is intended for aspiring Android developers who are new to programming and want to obtain the real-world skills needed to build Android apps at a high-level. Learn how to transform hand-drawn app designs into layouts using the XML markup language, and use Views and ViewGroups to display images and text. Harness the power of Java to build apps, learn how to show multiple screens, and add audio and images to an app. You will also learn how Android handles touch events, and make visual changes to add polish to an app. Finally, you will have a chance to discover the power of Web APIs and how to use them, and learn the basics of networking in Android, including HTTP networking, JSON parsing, and threads.



### 3. Front-end Web Expert

Programming knowledge is indispensable in today’s world, and learning to code is one of the most valuable and useful things you can do. As part of the front-end track, you will learn the basics of programming through HTML and CSS. In the first section, you will get oriented with and learn HTML, and then write your first line of code. Once you’ve familiarized yourself with HTML, you’re going to add style to your HTML code with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Experiment with adjusting various style rules in CSS to make your website shine. Achieve the look and presentation you want for your own webpage. Finally, you will also receive in-depth instruction on one of the most powerful tools available to programmers, Github, and how you can use Github to create code repos, commit changes to code, and review commits to existing code repos.



### 4. Data Analyst

Establish foundational data skills that will enable you to take the next important steps in your career. In this program, you will learn how to turn data into insights. What does that mean in practice? First, you will learn how to calculate statistics and build visuals used in industry to best display and communicate data insights. This will require you to first develop proficiency in Microsoft Excel and master the skills necessary to inform decision makers and make an impact using data. Next, you will learn one of the most powerful tools available to data analysts, Structured Query Language (SQL), and you will leverage SQL to extract and analyze data stored in databases.
